As part of a collaborative group of four students, I contributed to the design and development of a comprehensive website dedicated to promoting one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This project was an integral part of our coursework and allowed us to enhance our web design and development skills while raising awareness about critical global issues.

* Splash Screen: Introducing the website’s mission and team members.
* Home Page: Highlighting the importance of the selected SDG.
* Gallery: Showcasing relevant images and multimedia content.
* Shop: Offering products that support the SDG.
* User Profile: Enabling users to create and manage their profiles.
* Feedback Form: Gathering user feedback to improve the website.
* Sitemap: Providing an overview of the website’s structure.
* Team Page: Introducing the team members and their roles.

Each team member was responsible for specific tasks, ensuring every aspect of the website was meticulously crafted. Additionally, we each created a content page related to the website’s theme and an editor’s page outlining our individual contributions.

Our project aligns with the "Being Westminster" strategy, emphasizing progressive, compassionate, and responsible actions. By adopting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework, our website strives to contribute to various social, environmental, and economic outcomes.

Through this project, we have learned about web development, teamwork, and effective communication. We hope our website will serve as a valuable resource for raising awareness about our chosen SDG and inspire others to contribute to a more sustainable and equitable world.
